# ASCOM Alpaca Proxy Driver

The project also includes a standalone ASCOM Alpaca proxy driver written in Go. This application connects to the SV241 device via its serial port and exposes it to the ASCOM ecosystem as standard `Switch` and `ObservingConditions` devices.

> **Note:** While the proxy is written in Go and could theoretically run on other platforms, it is currently only tested and supported on **Windows**. The system tray integration and installer are Windows-specific.

*   Manages the connection to the device automatically.
*   Desktop notifications for device connection and disconnection events.
*   Helper scripts for easy, automated ASCOM driver creation.

## Important Security Notice

> **Warning:** All traffic between the astronomy software (client) and this Alpaca proxy driver is transmitted **unencrypted** over the network (HTTP).
>
> *   This means that **anyone on the same network** can potentially access the driver and control your device.
> *   By default, the proxy now listens only on `127.0.0.1` (localhost) for enhanced security. If you configure it to be accessible over the network, it is strongly recommended to restrict access to the proxy port (default `32241`) using **firewall rules**.
> *   Do not use this driver on unsecured networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi).

### Manually Creating a Firewall Rule

If you accidentally clicked "Cancel" or denied access when the Windows Defender Firewall prompt appeared on the first run, you will need to create a rule manually to allow your astronomy software to connect to the proxy.

1.  Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** as an **Administrator**.
2.  Copy and paste the following command, then press Enter:

```bash
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="SV241 Alpaca Proxy" dir=in action=allow program="%ProgramFiles(x86)%\SV241 Ascom Alpaca Proxy\AscomAlpacaProxy.exe" enable=yes
```

This command adds an inbound rule specifically for the `AscomAlpacaProxy.exe` application, allowing it to receive connections from your astronomy software.


### ASCOM Switch Device Actions

To provide functionality beyond the standard ASCOM `Switch` specification, the driver implements several custom **Actions**. These can be triggered by ASCOM client software that supports them, or manually via API calls.

#### Master Switch Actions

These actions provide a "Master Switch" to control all power outputs simultaneously.

*   `MasterSwitchOn`: Turns all power outputs on.
*   `MasterSwitchOff`: Turns all power outputs off.

#### Sensor Readout Actions

These actions allow reading the main power metrics directly from the `Switch` device, which can be convenient in some clients.

*   `getvoltage`: Returns the current input voltage (in Volts).
*   `getcurrent`: Returns the total current draw (in Amps).
*   `getpower`: Returns the total power consumption (in Watts).

#### Objective Temperature Action

*   `getlenstemperature`: Returns the current objective temperature (in °C) from the `ObservingConditions` device. Helpful for scripts that need this specific metric.


#### Using Actions via API (e.g., with `curl`)

You can trigger these actions from the command line using a tool like `curl`. The endpoint for actions is `/api/v1/switch/0/action` and the method is `PUT`.

**Example: Turn all switches off**
```bash
curl -X PUT -d "Action=MasterSwitchOff" http://localhost:32241/api/v1/switch/0/action
```

**Example: Get current voltage**
```bash
curl -X PUT -d "Action=getvoltage" http://localhost:32241/api/v1/switch/0/action
```
> **Note for Windows PowerShell users:** The standard `curl` command in PowerShell is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`, which has a different syntax and requires the `Content-Type` to be set explicitly. To use the master switch, the correct PowerShell command is:
> ```powershell
> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:32241/api/v1/switch/0/action -Method PUT -Body "Action=MasterSwitchOff" -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
> ```

## Accessing the Setup Page

The primary way to configure the SV241 Alpaca Proxy is through its built-in web interface. There are several ways to access it:

1.  **System Tray Icon (Recommended)**
    *   When the proxy is running, a new icon will appear in your system tray (usually in the bottom-right corner of the screen on Windows).
    *   **Right-click** the icon and select **"Open Setup Page"** from the menu. This will open the correct page in your default web browser.

2.  **Direct Browser URL**
    *   You can also access the page by manually entering the URL into your web browser. By default, the address is:
    *   `http://localhost:32241/setup`

3.  **If the Default Port is Busy**
    *   The proxy is configured to start on port `32241` by default. If another application is already using this port, the proxy will automatically search for the next available port (e.g., `32242`, `32243`, etc.).
    *   If you cannot connect using the default URL, check the `proxy.log` file located in the configuration directory. The log file will contain a line indicating which port the server started on, for example:
        ```
        [INFO] Starting Alpaca API server on port 8081...
        ```
    *   You would then use that port in the URL: `http://localhost:8081/setup`


## Telemetry & Logging

The proxy driver includes a robust telemetry system that logs sensor data to CSV files and provides interactive visualization.

### Automatic CSV Logging
*   **Frequency:** Telemetry data is logged every 10 seconds (configurable).
*   **Format:** Standard CSV files stored in `AscomAlpaca/logs/`.
*   **Rotation:** Logs use a "Noon-to-Noon" rotation strategy. This means a single "night's" imaging session is contained in one file, even if it spans across midnight. A new file is created automatically at 12:00 PM local time.
*   **Retention:** Old logs are automatically pruned. You can configure the number of nights to retain (default: 10) in the setup page.

### Interactive Visualization
The web interface features a built-in telemetry viewer:
*   Click on any sensor value (Voltage, Current, Temp, etc.) in the **Live Telemetry** panel to open the history chart.
*   **Interactive Chart:** Zoom and pan through the data to analyze power consumption or environmental changes over time.
*   **Historical Data:** Use the dropdown menu in the modal to load and view data from previous recording sessions.


## Driver Installation

To connect your astronomy software to this proxy, a driver must be registered within the ASCOM system. This step is necessary if your software cannot connect to the Alpaca device directly, which can happen for two main reasons:

1.  The software does not have a built-in Alpaca client and relies on the classic ASCOM Chooser.
2.  The software has an Alpaca client, but the automatic network discovery process is not working (e.g., due to firewall settings or network configuration).

Registering a driver solves this by creating a permanent entry in the ASCOM Chooser. This entry acts as a bridge, telling the system exactly how to find and communicate with the proxy.

We provide two methods for this registration: an easy, automated script and a manual method.

### Easy Driver Creation (Recommended)

The installer includes a helper script that automates the entire driver creation process. This is the recommended method as it is fast, easy, and avoids common configuration errors.

1.  **Open the Start Menu**
    *   Navigate to the program folder (usually named `SV241-Unbound`).

2.  **Run the Helper Script**
    *   Click on **"Create SV241 Ascom Driver"**.
    *   This will open a new window and launch an interactive script.

3.  **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**
    *   The script will ask you to select the driver type (`Switch` or `ObservingConditions`). The default is `Switch`.
    *   It will ask you to provide a name for the driver. A default name will be suggested.
    *   It will automatically detect the correct network port from your proxy configuration and suggest it as the default.
    *   Simply press **Enter** at each prompt to accept the defaults, which is sufficient in most cases.

4.  **Done**
    *   After a few moments, the script will confirm that the driver has been successfully created.

**Result:** The driver is now registered system-wide. You can now open your astronomy software and select the driver you just created (e.g., "SV241 Power Switch") directly from the device list.

> **Note:** You can run this script multiple times to create drivers with different names or to create both a `Switch` and an `ObservingConditions` driver.

---

### Manual Driver Creation (Fallback)

If you prefer to set up the driver manually, or if the helper script fails for any reason, you can use the "ASCOM Diagnostics" application that comes with the ASCOM Platform.

1.  **Start ASCOM Diagnostics**

    Open the "ASCOM Diagnostics" application.
    *   You can find it in the Windows Start Menu under the "ASCOM Platform" folder.

2.  **Open the "Switch Chooser"**

    *   In the main window of ASCOM Diagnostics, select the device type `Switch` from the "Select Device Type" dropdown list.
    *   Click the `Choose Device...` button next to it.

3.  **Create a New Alpaca Driver**

    The "ASCOM Switch Chooser" window will open.
    *   In the menu bar of this window, click on `Alpaca`.
    *   Select `Create Alpaca Driver (Admin)` from the dropdown menu.
    *   Windows (UAC) may ask for administrative rights. Please confirm this.

4.  **Name the Driver**

    A small dialog box will ask for a name.
    *   Enter a descriptive name, e.g., `My Manual SV241 Switch`
    *   Click `OK`.

5.  **Configure the Alpaca Connection (Most Important Step)**

    You are now back in the "ASCOM Switch Chooser". Your new driver (e.g., `Switch.My_Manual_SV241_Switch`) is now highlighted in the list.
    *   Click the `Properties...` button.
    *   A setup window will open. Enter the exact connection details here:
        *   **Remote Device Host Name or IP Address:** `localhost`
        *   **Alpaca Port:** `32241` (or the port your proxy is running on)
        *   **Remote Device Number:** `0` (default for the first device)
    *   Click `OK` in the setup window.

6.  **Finalize Selection**

    *   Click `OK` in the "ASCOM Switch Chooser" window as well.

7.  **Test (Optional, but Recommended)**

    *   You are now back in the main window of ASCOM Diagnostics. The name of your new driver is now in the text field.
    *   Click `Connect`.
    *   If everything is configured correctly, the connection should be established successfully (the fields in the "Capabilities" section will be populated).

**Result:** Your manually configured driver "My Manual SV241 Switch" is now permanently registered in the ASCOM system. When you now start NINA (or other software), you can select it directly from the device list without having to enter the IP address again.

> **Note:** Repeat this process for the `ObservingConditions` device to also add the environmental sensors manually.


## Configuration

The proxy creates its configuration files in the following directory on Windows:
*   **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\SV241AlpacaProxy\`

### Manual Configuration (`proxy_config.json`)

While most settings can be configured via the web interface, it is also possible to edit the `proxy_config.json` file directly. This can be useful for troubleshooting or for setting up the proxy in a headless environment.

Here is an example of the `proxy_config.json` file structure:

```json
{
  "serialPortName": "COM9",
  "autoDetectPort": false,
  "networkPort": 32241,
  "listenAddress": "127.0.0.1",
  "logLevel": "INFO",
  "historyRetentionNights": 10,
  "telemetryInterval": 10,
  "enableAlpacaVoltageControl": false,
  "enableMasterPower": true,
  "switchNames": {
    "adj_conv": "Adjustable Voltage",
    "dc1": "Camera",
    "dc2": "Mount",
    "dc3": "Focuser",
    "dc4": "Filter Wheel",
    "dc5": "Unused",
    "pwm1": "Main Dew Heater",
    "pwm2": "Guide Scope Heater",
    "usb345": "USB Hub 1",
    "usbc12": "USB Hub 2",
    "master_power": "Master Power"
  },
  "heaterAutoEnableLeader": {
    "pwm1": true,
    "pwm2": true
  }
}
```

**Parameter Explanation:**

*   `serialPortName` (string): The name of the serial port for the SV241 device (e.g., `"COM9"`). If this string is empty (`""`), the proxy will attempt to auto-detect the port on startup.
    > **Note:** When `Auto-Detect Port` is enabled (or `serialPortName` is empty), the proxy probes all available USB serial ports to find the SV241. This "safe-but-aggressive" probing can potentially interfere with other sensitive devices (e.g., Mounts, Weather Stations). **Solution:** To prevent conflicts, connect the SV241 once to let it auto-detect, then **disable "Auto-Detect Port"** (or uncheck the box in the web UI). The proxy will then strictly only open the configured port.
*   `autoDetectPort` (boolean): When `true`, the proxy will attempt to find the SV241 automatically if the configured port fails. Default is `true`.
*   `networkPort` (integer): The TCP port on which the Alpaca API server will listen for connections from client applications. The default is `32241`. A restart of the proxy is required for changes to this value to take effect.
*   `listenAddress` (string): The IP address to bind the server to. Use `"127.0.0.1"` for local-only access (recommended for security) or `"0.0.0.0"` to allow network access. Default is `"127.0.0.1"`.
*   `logLevel` (string): Controls the verbosity of the log file. Valid values are `"ERROR"`, `"WARN"`, `"INFO"`, and `"DEBUG"`. This setting is applied live when changed.
*   `historyRetentionNights` (integer): The number of days/nights to retain CSV telemetry logs. Older files are automatically deleted at startup. Default is `10`.
*   `telemetryInterval` (integer): The interval in seconds between telemetry log entries. Default is `10`.
*   `enableAlpacaVoltageControl` (boolean): When `true`, the adjustable voltage output can be controlled as a slider (0-15V) via ASCOM. When `false`, it behaves as a simple on/off switch. Default is `false`.
*   `enableMasterPower` (boolean): When `true`, a "Master Power" switch is exposed via ASCOM that controls all outputs simultaneously. Default is `false`.
*   `switchNames` (object): A map that allows you to assign custom, user-friendly names to the internal switch identifiers. The `key` is the internal name (e.g., `"dc1"`) and the `value` is the custom name you want to see in ASCOM clients and the web interface.
*   `heaterAutoEnableLeader` (object): Controls automatic leader activation for PID-Sync mode. When a follower heater (in mode 3) is enabled, the proxy can automatically enable its leader heater. Keys are `"pwm1"` and `"pwm2"`, values are `true`/`false`.


### Log Level Configuration

The proxy driver provides a configurable logging level to control the amount of detail written to the log file (`proxy.log` in the configuration directory). This is useful for both normal operation and detailed troubleshooting. The log level can be set in the **"Proxy Connection Settings"** section of the web setup page.

The available levels are:

*   **ERROR**: Logs only critical errors that prevent the proxy from working correctly (e.g., failure to open a serial port, server start failure).
*   **WARN**: Logs warnings about non-critical issues that the proxy can recover from (e.g., a temporary connection loss, auto-detection failures).
*   **INFO** (Default): Logs major events during normal operation, such as application start/stop, successful connections, and configuration changes. This level provides a good overview without being too verbose.
*   **DEBUG**: Logs highly detailed information, including every incoming HTTP request, every command sent to the device, and periodic status checks. This level is extremely useful for diagnosing communication problems with ASCOM client software but will create very large log files.

### Log Rotation

To prevent the log file from growing indefinitely, the proxy performs a simple rotation upon every start:
1.  The existing `proxy.log` is renamed to `proxy.log.old`, overwriting any previous `.old` file.
2.  A new, empty `proxy.log` is created for the current session.

This ensures that the logs from the current and the immediately preceding session are always available for troubleshooting.
